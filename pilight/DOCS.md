## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

`
2. Find the "Pilight Server" add-on and click it.
3. Click on the `INSTALL` button.

#### **ATTENTION**: For now the Addon is only working on the Raspberry Pi with armhf | armv7 | aarch64 architecture

## How to use

1. Install a 433 MHz transmitter and/or receiver to your Raspberry Pi. A documentation about this can be found [here][433mhz_tutorial].
   Connect the transmitter/receiver to the pins you like, but note the numbers according to the layout that can be found at [wiringx.org][wiringx], as they will be needed in the `sender` and `receiver` setting of the configuration.
1. Go to Configuration and enter the `gpio_platform` with a platform supported by [Pilight Platforms][pilight_platforms]
1. Adapt the `sender` and `receiver` options to the pins you selected in Step 1.
1. Finally set the port you want the Pilight Server to listen to new queries. Default is `5010`.

## Add-on Configuration

The Pilight server add-on can now be tweaked to your likings.

Setting the `debug` switch to true enables the debug output of the pilight daemon.

Example configuration:

```yaml
gpio_platform: raspberrypi3
hardware:
  sender: 0
  receiver: 1
debug: false
```
